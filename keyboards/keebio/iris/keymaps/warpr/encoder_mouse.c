# Example

See https://github.com/muppetjones/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/kyria/keymaps/muppetjones
 
# Description

Use encoders to control mouse movement. Movement speed is determined by
how quickly and how many times you've "clicked" the encoder. Turning both
encoders together will yield diagonal movement.

Several of the macros defined in quantum/mousekey.h are reused here.
However, the mouse movement is actually performed using the pointing_device
features instead.

# Usage

- Add the following to your rules.mk

        ENCODER_ENABLE = yes       # Enables the use of one or more encoders
        POINTING_DEVICE_ENABLE = yes
        
        SRC += "encoder_mouse.c"

- Add the following block to your keymap.c
  (NOTE: The `encoder_update_*` signature returns a bool in 
  more recent versions of QMK.)

        #ifdef ENCODER_ENABLE
        void encoder_update_user(uint8_t index, bool clockwise) {
        #    ifdef POINTING_DEVICE_ENABLE
            encoder_update_mouse(index, clockwise);
        #    endif
            return;
        #endif

# Description

- The faster you turn, the faster the mouse moves.
- The more turns for a given axis, the greater the movement on that axis.
